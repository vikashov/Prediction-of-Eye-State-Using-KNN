# Prediction-of-Eye-State-Using-KNN
## Introduction:
Automating the identification of human eye state (Open or Close) has many lifesaving applications in real life such as predicting road accident, infant sleep-waking state identification, border security, home security or security personal deployed at crucial security places and many more.In rhis project i'm using KNN algorithm with Walk-forward validation and i got 99% accuracy.
